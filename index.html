          Why Music
        </h1>
        Music can stimulate the mind. There are many things in music, to which
        one can listen and bring attention. One can be mindful of the melodies
        or themes, the harmony, the driving or relaxed rhythms, the color of the
        sounds, the activity of a piece, how the sounds are produced, or how
        they all relate to one another, all while, possibly figuring out how the
        composer conceived the piece. Focused and attentive listening is an
        incredible experience that allows one to be lost in a foreign sound
        world.

          including security, biometrics, law enforcement, entertainment and
          personal safety -- to provide surveillance and tracking of people in
          real time.Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an
          individual’s identity using their face. Facial recognition systems can
